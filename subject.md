＃　Projet roadmap
The work required is divided into four stages, each of which is described as
follows:
- 1) Pre-project: define an issue related directly or indirectly to tourism issues.
Describe your use case and prove the feasibility of your idea by specifying the
source sites for your data. To prove feasibility, I recommend that you test scraping
data from the sites identified and checking whether the data obtained is
interesting.
- 2) Scraping the data: in this step, you describe the structure of the data you put in
place following the scrapping and its origins. You should also describe the quality
of your data in terms of representativeness, the completeness of the values, the
cleaning and the homogenization of the data (which structures, databases, etc.). \
The aim of this stage is to present the difficulties encountered during the
scrapping, the solutions found and the presentation of the final structure of your
data.
- 3) Describe the machine learning problem (the machine learning task(s) you wish
to implement as part of your project). Visualizations, or the reduction of data in
order to understand it, are considered to be tasks.
- 4) The final prototype you are proposing in terms of a web application, or an
exploratory notebook, an information search interface, etc. \

## Some requirements:
- Your project must include textual data and a related problem. A bonus is
awarded if you manage to connect this project to the second project in the NLP
module,
- The project must deal with a subject related to tourism
- The project must take into account an ecological and responsible dimension
(social, personal, etc.)
- The data collected must be obtained using at least one of the following techniques:
    - a) scraping via API ,
    - b)scraping via selenium/beautifulsoup. 
The data is therefore obtained by a)+b) minimum.

## Deliverables:
- 13/12: the final version of the pre-project with the first scrapping notebooks
- 26/12: the link to the data collected in csv format and the scrapping notebook
(github)
- 15/01: the link to the Machien learning notebook
- 20/01: a user manual for illustrating use cases for your prototype.
- Defense: date to be defined (in progress) during exam week.
- At the end of the project, you are invited to submit on DVO a) your final Python
code, b) your production, c) your oral presentation (the slides)
- Prepare an oral presentation describing your project (aim, hypothesis, method,
problems. solutions, results (as a demo), conclusions) in 5 minutes.
